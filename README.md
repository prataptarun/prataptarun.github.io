## WEB-VR for Real Estate
This project presents a particular VR implementation done for a real estate developer.
This implementation focuses on increasing immersion and is most suitable for properties that are to be built. It is the latest development of the VR4RE (Virtual Reality for Real Estate)
project, which aims at saving time and money for both real estate sellers and buyers by employing modern technologies. VR4RE is one of the innovative projects developed by
Bluemind Software. We can see a drastic change is the usage of the virtual reality after introduction of webvr.
